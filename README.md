## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **C++ Compiler:** GCC (MinGW recommended for Windows)
- **Python 3.x:** Required for file conversion and sorting scripts
- **Python Packages:** `pandas`, `openpyxl`  
  Install with:
  ```
  pip install pandas openpyxl
  ```

### Build Instructions

1. **Using Code::Blocks:**  
   Open `Updating System V1.3.cbp` and build the project (Debug/Release).

2. **Using Command Line (MinGW):**
   ```sh
   g++ -std=gnu++17 -Wall -o bin/Debug/UpdatingSystem main.cpp operations.cpp file_handler.cpp logger.cpp
   ```

3. **Ensure Python is in your PATH** and required packages are installed.

---

## Usage Guide

### 1. **Launching the Application**

Run the executable from `bin/Debug/` or your build output directory:
```sh
./Updating\ System\ V1.exe
```

### 2. **File Input**

- The program will prompt for paths to the Stock, Price, and App sheets.
- Supports `.csv`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.xlsx`, `.xls` files.
- If a non-CSV file is provided, it will attempt conversion using `html_to_csv_converter.py`.

### 3. **Main Menu Options**

The application provides a menu-driven interface with the following options:

1. **Search for a product by code** (in Stock, Price, or App sheet)
2. **Update stock** in Stock Sheet
3. **Update price** in Price Sheet
4. **Add a new product** (to any sheet)
5. **Synchronize and update App Sheet** (VLOOKUP from Stock/Price)
6. **Sort App Sheet by SKU** & remove rows with multiple numbers in SKU
7. **Export App Sheet** (to a new file)
8. **Save All Sheets and Exit**
9. **Delete first 10 rows** from Price Sheet
10. **Unmerge columns I & J** in Price Sheet
11. **Move P column (Ø§Ù„ÙƒÙˆØ¯) to H column** in Price Sheet
12. **Delete repeated (Ø§Ù„Ø³Ø¹Ø±) column** from Price Sheet
13. **Delete first 6 columns** from Price Sheet
14. **Set home nursing services stock to 9000000** in App Sheet
15. **Convert all nan values to 0** in App Sheet

## C++ Application Details

### **main.cpp**
- Handles user interaction, menu, and file input/output.
- Calls Python scripts for file conversion and sorting as needed.
- Manages the main loop and dispatches operations.

### **operations.cpp / operations.h**
- Implements all core data operations:
  - Product search, stock/price update, product addition
  - App Sheet synchronization (VLOOKUP logic)
  - Data cleaning (remove rows, unmerge columns, etc.)
  - Exporting and saving sheets

### **file_handler.cpp / file_handler.h**
- Provides CSV reading and writing utilities.
- Handles parsing and serializing 2D data.

### **logger.cpp / logger.h**
- Logs all changes and operations to `log.txt` with timestamps.

---

## Python Utilities

### **html_to_csv_converter.py**
- Converts HTML tables and Excel files to CSV.
- Can be run standalone or called by the C++ app.
- Usage:
  ```sh
  python html_to_csv_converter.py --single-file input.html output.csv
  ```

### **sort_csv_by_column.py**
- Sorts a CSV file numerically by a specified column (e.g., SKU).
- Removes rows with multiple numbers in SKU and those with numbers longer than 6 digits.
- Usage:
  ```sh
  python sort_csv_by_column.py input.csv output.csv sku
  ```

---

## Logging

- All significant operations (updates, synchronizations, sorts, etc.) are logged in `log.txt`.
- Each entry includes a timestamp and a description of the change.

---

## Build & Configuration

- **Code::Blocks:** Project file provided (`.cbp`).
- **VSCode:** Includes `.vscode/` settings for IntelliSense and file associations.
- **Compiler:** Configured for GCC, C++17 standard.
- **Dependencies:** Only standard C++ libraries and Python packages (`pandas`, `openpyxl`).
